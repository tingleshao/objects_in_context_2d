2d Objects in Context Prototyping System
=======

##Description
rablo2d is a tool for: <br/>
1. Producing 2d objects in medial representation. <br/>
2. Analyzing their relationship in multi-object context. <br/>
3. Generating data for multi-object statistics.<br/>
##Install
To use me, you need to install:
* [Ruby 1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/downloads) (more stable in Linux than in Windows)
  * I had experienced compiling shoes in Ubuntu, by missing something in ruby-dev. Solutions can be found in Stackoverflow.
* [Python](http://www.python.org/getit/)/[SciPy and NumPy](http://www.scipy.org/Download)/[Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/downloads)
  * current version uses functions in SciPy and NumPy to compute B-Spline interpolation. This may be changed later. 


##Start
<br/>
To run me, you can go to the directory that contains me and type the following command:

      $ shoes main.rb
